Title - Student Innovation - Fitness & Sports - Ideas that can boost fitness activities and assist in keeping fit.
Our basic idea of this website is to provide customers basic diet plan and workout through recorded videos and live classes as per membership plans which will make their way towards fitness more easier.
This is the basic structure of the website for the first evaluation
We have included the login page and the headers include workout, programs, diets, about section and membership plan. We have also included pricing panel under the membership plan in the header section and later hours we will be working more in making the website more responsive and finally adding the footer. We will also add videos to make it more user friendly and will also add more features in later hours.
